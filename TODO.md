# NERD 2026 Application — TODO

Deadline: **19 February 2026, 14:00 CET**

---

## CRITICAL (blocking submission)

- [ ] **Brief Project Description over limit** — currently ~2,458 chars, max is 2,000. Must cut ~460 chars.
- [ ] **Figures: only 4 allowed, must be PNG/JPG/BMP** — currently have ~6 candidates, all in PDF. Must select 4, convert to PNG, and resize to ≤1050×1650 pixels. Current sizes exceed this (e.g. conceptual figure is 1920×1240).
- [ ] **Literature References section** — separate NORMA field, max 8,000 chars. Not yet drafted. Must list all cited works (authors, year, title, journal, volume). Own pubs as "Anonymised Reference [N]". Does NOT count toward 30,000 char project description.
- [ ] **Hosting letter** — PDF signed by head of department. Must confirm: (a) institution provides infrastructure/facilities/admin, (b) applicant's grant portfolio ≤ DKK 4.0M in year of commencing. Request from department ASAP if not already done.
- [ ] **Choose project title** — three options drafted (A: 112 chars, B: 132 chars, C: 110 chars). Pick one.

## PROPOSAL TAB (Stage 1, anonymous)

- [ ] **Project Description** — resolve inline editorial comments:
  - [ ] Line 61: two bracketed thoughts on framing the problem statement
  - [ ] Line 73: `[KM: Frame this as explanation for why genetic basis for ASD differs between males and females]`
  - [ ] Line 77: `[KM: if short on space, this section can be made shorter]` (HUWE1 paragraph)
  - [ ] Lines 97/101: popgen lingo concerns ("selective sweep", "hitchhiking")
  - [ ] Line 147: `[spin-off projects]` placeholder in Future Applications
- [ ] **Project Description** — WP3 and WP4 editing pass (KM to add italic comments, then suggest-accept workflow)
- [ ] **Project Description** — fix typos in KM edits: "dispite" → despite, "persistance" → persistence, "neigborhood" → neighborhood, "crusual" → crucial, "whos" → whose, "neighorhood" → neighborhood, "Eeach" → Each, "will will" → will, etc.
- [ ] **Abbreviations list** — check completeness after all edits (currently inside the 30K limit, which is correct per guidelines: "preferably a list of abbreviations should be included in the project description")
- [ ] **Lay Project Description** — OK at 769 / 1,000 chars. Review for final polish.
- [ ] **Non-anonymized reference list** — PDF appendix mapping "Anonymised Reference [N]" to real citations. For Stage 2 evaluation. Upload under Appendices tab.

## APPLICANT TAB (full application required at Stage 1)

- [ ] **CV** — max 4,000 chars. Must include: total peer-reviewed publications, first authorships, corresponding authorships, number of citations, h-index.
- [ ] **Publication list** — max 5,000 chars. Up to 10 most relevant publications, all authors listed, own name highlighted. Include link to ORCID/Google Scholar/Scopus.
- [ ] **Summary of own research** — max 2,000 chars. Research focus and main contributions relevant to this application.
- [ ] **Supplementary information**:
  - [ ] Terms of employment (permanent vs. contract, when contract ends, salary coverage)
  - [ ] Research time (%) committed to this project
  - [ ] Overview of current active grants and grants in past 5 years: how each differs from this project, % research time committed to each

---

## BUDGET TAB

- [ ] **Enter budget into NORMA template** — existing NERD_2026_Budget.xlsx (3 PDs + 2 PhDs, DKK 12,605,800) as reference. NORMA has its own budget template that becomes available after entering grant period.
- [ ] **Review budget headroom** — DKK 3.4M remains under 16M ceiling. Consider: operating expenses (compute time, conference travel, publication costs), PhD tuition fees (up to DKK 80,000/yr/student, listed separately), project supplement (Danish university indirect costs).
- [ ] **PhD tuition fees** — must be included as separate line item per guidelines (up to DKK 80,000/budget year).
- [ ] **Project supplement** — covers indirect costs at Danish universities, replaces bench fee/admin support. Check Universities Denmark joint model.

## FIGURES (select 4 of these candidates)

Constraints: max 4 uploads, JPG/JPEG/PNG/BMP only, max 50 MB, max 1050×1650 px, no identifying info.

1. Drive model
2. Multi-panel figure:
  1. Three-way Venn diagram with lists of genes in each overlap group. 
  2. Gene names could be colored if at A/B borders
  3. Expression trajectories HUWE1 and RBMX2
3. A/B eigenvector plot with RBMX2 including zoom panel
4. Project timeline / Gantt chart with vertical lines connecting work packages at the times where they are expected to exchange results

## QUALITY CHECKS (before submission)

- [ ] **Anonymity audit** — check all Stage 1 materials (project description, figures, references) for anything revealing identity. The Skov et al. 2023 paper is co-authored; the specific combination of meiotic drive + X + autism + Danish cohort could be identifying.
- [ ] **Character counts** — final pass on all fields:
  - Title: ≤150 chars
  - Brief description: ≤2,000 chars
  - Project description: ≤30,000 chars
  - Literature references: ≤8,000 chars
  - Lay description: ≤1,000 chars
  - CV: ≤4,000 chars
  - Publication list: ≤5,000 chars
  - Summary of own research: ≤2,000 chars
- [ ] **Spelling/grammar** — final proofread (American English throughout)
- [ ] **Cross-reference check** — ensure all [Anonymized Reference N] cited in text appear in both the anonymized reference list (Literature References field) and the non-anonymized appendix
- [ ] **Assessment criteria alignment** — committee evaluates: scientific quality, creativity, novelty, ambition, feasibility, and dedication (time). Verify the application addresses each.

## NICE TO HAVE (if time permits)

- [ ] Gantt chart timeline figure
- [ ] Zoom panel insert for RBMX2 in A/B compartment figure (KM's HTML comment)
- [ ] Annotate figures with panel labels (Fig 1a, 1b, etc.) to match in-text references
- [ ] Draft a figure legend document (not required by NORMA but useful for reference)
