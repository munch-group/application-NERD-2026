## 2. BRIEF PROJECT DESCRIPTION (max 2,000 characters)

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is four times more common in boys than in girls — one of the most robust findings in psychiatry — yet no satisfactory genetic explanation exists for this sex bias. This project proposes that both sex chromosomes actively drive ASD risk through distinct evolutionary mechanisms, and that recognizing these mechanisms will transform our understanding of how ASD-relevant variation is maintained in human populations.

The core idea draws on intragenomic conflict theory. In males, sperm cells carrying the X chromosome compete against those carrying the Y. An X-linked gene that is expressed after the cell division separating X- and Y-bearing sperm can bias its own transmission *\[by killing or compromizing the other kind\]* — a phenomenon called meiotic drive *\[a driving variant can be deleterious (ie. break/disrupt/disable/distort) as long as it it confers a relative advantage to the sex-chromosome it is located on\]*. Because roughly one in four neuron genes is also expressed in sperm cells, this transmission advantage comes at a cost: variants favored during sperm competition may be mildly harmful for brain development. We present pilot evidence that genes at this intersection — which are both differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing sperm, promoted by natural selection, and associated with ASD — overlap far more than expected by chance.

*In addition to the effects of individual gene variants on transmission*, the Y chromosome may affect this this by a separate mechanism. Human Y chromosomes differ dramatically in the amount of repetitive heterochromatin they carry. This structural variation may titrate chromatin-modifying proteins away from the rest of the genome, altering which genes are accessible/expressed *\[here the reader should hear that this epigenetic control is part of the arms race for controlling X/Y transmission\]* and thereby creating Y-lineage-dependent differences in ASD risk.

*\[Maybe a sentence letting the reader know that what is really important is that the genes on the 22 non-sex chromosomes continually evolve to counter uneven transmission and that mutations restoring even transimission will be promoted by natural selection dispite moderate deleterious effects (ASD)\]*

The project combines population genomics, clinical cohort analysis of more than 22,000 ASD cases, comparative primate genomics, and formal evolutionary modeling, \[*all required to ....\]*

### The Problem

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects nearly 3% of children in Denmark and shows a 4:1 ratio of affected boys to girls. This sex bias is among the most replicated observations in human genetics, yet genome-wide association studies (GWAS) — which scan the genome for variants correlated with disease risk — have largely excluded the sex chromosomes from analysis due to their non-standard inheritance. The X chromosome is present in two copies in females but only one in males; the Y chromosome is present only in males. A report shows that the X accounts for approximately 20% of neuro-anatomical variation relevant to ASD despite constituting only 5% of the genome \[Mallard et al. 2021\]. \[*The real shortcomming of the current state of art does not address the unique molecular evolution driven by sex-chromosome inter-genomic conflict\]* This project develops the analytical framework needed to bring the sex chromosomes into the study of ASD *\[both in their own right, but also as epigenetic modulators crusical for understanding the genetic basis of ASD across the entire genome\]*, and tests two specific hypotheses about how evolutionary forces on X and Y contribute to autism risk.

### Hypothesis 1: Meiotic Drive on the X Chromosome

**The basic mechanism.** During the production of sperm cells (spermatogenesis), a precursor cell containing both X and Y divides to produce two types of haploid cells: sperm carrying the X, and sperm carrying the Y. Early in this process, a phenomenon called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) shuts down transcription from the sex chromosomes. MSCI is thought to prevent genes on the X from acting against Y-bearing cells or vice versa. However, some genes escape this silencing and are re-expressed in the haploid sperm cells (spermatids). A gene that escapes silencing in X-bearing spermatids can, in principle, bias its own transmission — for example by enhancing motility or survival of X-bearing sperm at the expense of Y-bearing sperm. This is meiotic drive: a violation of Mendel's law of equal segregation, driven by molecular competition within the germline.

Drive is widespread in nature. It has been documented in fungi, insects, and mammals, and theoretical models predict it should be especially common on the X chromosome, which spends two-thirds of evolutionary time in females (where it recombines) and one-third in males (where it does not).

**Why drive is hard to observe directly.** A natural objection is that transmission distortion and sex-ratio bias have not been reported in humans. This is expected, because an even sex ratio is a game-theoretic equilibrium — Fisher's principle: when one sex is rarer, individuals producing more offspring of that sex gain more grandchildren, so any variant restoring even transmission is strongly favored by natural selection, even if that variant is mildly deleterious in other respects. A driver distorting X/Y transmission therefore triggers immediate counter-selection: existing variants on the Y or autosomes that restore balanced transmission are swept to high frequency, and new mutations with the same effect are favored as they arise. Drive is therefore transient: it flares, pushes the driver (and its hitchhiking neighborhood) to high frequency, and then subsides as suppressors equilibrate the sex ratio — leaving no ongoing bias but a lasting footprint of elevated allele frequencies. Crucially, suppressors are themselves under strong positive selection and drag along their own hitchhiking neighborhoods of mildly deleterious alleles — the arms race generates collateral damage on both sides. This transient, self-erasing dynamic means drive is best detected through its evolutionary signatures (selective sweeps, hitchhiking) rather than through contemporary transmission ratios.

**The link to autism.** Proteomic surveys show that roughly 80% of brain proteins are also present in testis, and approximately one in four genes active in neurons is also expressed in spermatids \[Matos et al. 2021\]. This overlap creates an evolutionary conflict: a gene variant may be selected for its advantage in spermatogenesis dispite being mildly deleterious for brain development. Meiotic drive turbo-charges this conflict: The natural selection on a X chromosome gene conferring a 10% transmission advantage of X-carrying sperm is on par with the strongest natural selection observed in humans (lactase persistance). In addition ASD risk associated with the driver itself, any ASD risk variants in the genomic neigborhood will "hitchhike" to higher population frequency along with the driver.

*\[KM: Frame this as an explanation for why gene genetic basis for ASD differ so much between males and females\]* Second, the "dosage-conflict" prediction: because MSCI and somatic X chromosome inactivation (XCI, the process by which one X is silenced in female cells) share a conserved silencing mechanism \[Hornecker et al. 2007\], genes that escape MSCI in sperm will also tend to escape XCI in females. Since the X chromosome spends two-thirds of evolutionary time in females, selection will resolve the resulting female dosage excess by reducing expression. This leaves males — who have only one copy — with too little expression. For neurodevelopmental genes, this dosage deficiency creates a male-specific risk.\]

**Pilot evidence — five converging lines.** (i) An analysis of evolutionary trees (genealogies) reconstructed from population genomic data identifies 35 X-linked genes under recent positive selection; among these nine are ASD-associated, representing a highly significant enrichment (fisher p-value 5.95 × 10⁻⁵). Supporting a connection between selection, spermatogenesis and ASD, we also find that among brain-expressed genes, selection is significantly more frequent among genes also expressed in spermatids (p = 0.002) \[Anonymized Reference 3\]. (ii) Because post-meiotic spermatids share cytoplasm through intercellular bridges, most transcripts are equally distributed; genes that nonetheless differ must be regulated cell-autonomously offering the potential to act as a drivers. We find that ASD genes (SFARI database) are significantly enriched among genes differentially expressed between X-bearing and Y-bearing spermatids (p = 0.004) \[Anonymized Reference 6\]. (iii) MAGMA analysis of a large Danish clinical cohort shows that neuron genes co-expressed in spermatids are significantly enriched for ASD association in males (p = 0.030), while neuron genes without spermatid expression show no enrichment — confirming that specifically the dual-function genes carry risk \[Anonymized Reference 2\]. (iv) Intersecting three independent gene sets — ASD genes (SFARI database), genes under positive selection, and genes differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing spermatids — yields five genes in the triple overlap (CDKL5, CLCN4, HUWE1, IL1RAPL1, PTCHD1), all of them well-established ASD risk genes \[Anonymized References 3, 6\]. Each pairwise and triple overlap is statistically significant. (v) Regarding the different genetic basis of ASD in males and females, ASD association is elevated among genes that escape female XCI (p = 0.027), as the dosage-conflict model predicts \[Anonymized Reference 2\].

*\[KM: if short on space, this sections can be made shorter. The message can be conveyed with fewer details\]* **HUWE1 — the conflict made concrete.** Among the five triple-overlap genes, HUWE1 in particular lends itself to a case study exposing the neuron–spermatid conflict at the mechanistic level: HUWE1 is an X-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase originally characterized for its role in testis chromatin biology: it ubiquitinates all four core histones during spermiogenesis, localizes to the sex body during pachytene — directly implicating it in MSCI — and conditional knockout in differentiating spermatogonia causes meiotic arrest and complete infertility. In the brain, the same gene regulates neural progenitor differentiation via p53 and N-Myc pathways; loss-of-function mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability with autistic features in roughly one-third of patients. HUWE1 thus embodies the dual-function gene concept in its most literal form: a locus under selection in the germline for chromatin remodeling whose perturbation has direct neurodevelopmental consequences. Its presence in the triple overlap — ASD-associated, positively selected, and differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing spermatids — is therefore not a statistical coincidence but a reflection of the underlying biology this project aims to dissect.

### Hypothesis 2: The Y Chromosome as a Chromatin Regulator

**The heterochromatin sink.** The second hypothesis concerns the Y chromosome not as a carrier of protein-coding genes — it has very few — but as a structural element that sequesters chromatin-modifying proteins. Large portions of the Y consist of repetitive DNA packaged as heterochromatin, a condensed form of chromatin associated with gene silencing. Maintaining heterochromatin requires specific proteins (notably HP1 and the methyltransferase SUV39H) that exist in limited quantities in the nucleus. A Y chromosome carrying more heterochromatin will sequester more of these proteins, leaving fewer available to maintain heterochromatin elsewhere in the genome. This "sink" effect has been rigorously demonstrated in Drosophila, where adding or removing Y chromosomes causes measurable genome-wide redistribution of histone marks at the boundaries between heterochromatin and euchromatin (the active form of chromatin) \[Brown et al. 2020\].

*\[KM: This section should appear as evidence supporting a very strong paternal effect pointing to a global modulating role of Y\]* Evidence from a macaque half-brother study further demonstrates that paternal genotype makes a disproportionate contribution to heritability of a sub-sociality trait — a phenotype correlated with ASD in human children — pointing directly at spermatogenesis as the arena in which heritable neurodevelopmental risk is shaped.

**Variation between human Y haplogroups.** Recent telomere-to-telomere assemblies of 43 human Y chromosomes \[Rhie et al. 2023\] reveal striking structural variation between Y lineages (haplogroups). Centromeric repeat arrays vary more than 2-fold in size between major haplogroups (e.g. haplogroup R1b: mean 341 kbp; haplogroup I: mean 787 kbp). The DYZ1 satellite repeat varies over an order of magnitude (7–98 Mb). In Denmark, most men carry a Y from either haplogroup I or haplogroup R, making the Danish clinical cohort an ideal testing ground for haplogroup-dependent effects.

**Predictions.** If the sink model operates in humans, haplogroup I males (more Y heterochromatin) should show weakened heterochromatin boundaries elsewhere in the genome — potentially exposing genetic variants in normally silenced regions near centromeres. Autosomal GWAS hits should differ systematically between haplogroup backgrounds, not because the autosomal variants themselves differ, but because the chromatin context determining their activity differs. This is a form of epistasis (gene-gene interaction) that standard GWAS, which ignores the Y, cannot detect.

**Preliminary evidence.** Stratifying males in the Danish clinical cohort by Y haplogroup reveals that different variants reach statistical significance depending on haplogroup background \[Anonymized Reference 4\]. This context-dependent association is what the sink model predicts: the same variant has different penetrance depending on whether the Y chromosome creates a strong or weak heterochromatin sink. The RBMX2 gene shows significant GWAS association with ASD among males carrying Y chromosomes from haplogroup I, but no association among haplogroup R males — despite the R cohort being larger, ruling out a simple power explanation \[Anonymized Reference 4\]. Crucially, RBMX2 sits precisely at the edge of an A compartment on the X chromosome — exactly the boundary position where the sink model predicts Y heterochromatin content will modulate gene accessibility \[Anonymized Reference 5\]. If haplogroup I's greater heterochromatin load shifts this boundary, RBMX2 could move from active to silenced chromatin, altering its expression and its contribution to ASD risk.

**Bridging hypothesis 1 and 2.** It turns out RBMX2 may also be a poster child for Hypothesis 1: It not only has a paralog on the Y chromosome (RBMY2) but also a retrotransposed copy (RBMXL2) on the chromosome 11. These genes encode splicing-fidelity factors, thus providing each player in the three-way X-Y-Autosome arms a means to influence broad downstream effects on transcript integrity in the germline.

### Research Plan

The project is organized around four work packages, each requiring distinct technical expertise. A key design principle is that work packages run concurrently rather than sequentially, enabling postdocs and PhD students to contribute to and benefit from results across packages in real time. Three postdocs and two PhD students have staggered start dates to support the recruiting effort and initial supervision. Access to the large Danish ASD clinical cohort (more than 17,000 male and 5,500 female cases) is provided through an established and ongoing collaboration with a psychiatric genetics group that maintains the genotyping infrastructure and data governance. This collaboration has already produced the pilot results presented above and will continue throughout the project period, ensuring seamless data access from project start.

**Work Package 1: Y-stratified genome-wide association analysis incl. the X chromosome.** This package performs the first systematic inclusion of both sex chromosomes in ASD genetic association studies. We begin with sex-stratified GWAS and X chromosome-specific association analysis (XWAS) in the Danish clinical cohort. Standard GWAS software assumes diploid autosomes; the X requires separate treatment of males (hemizygous) and females (one copy silenced by XCI). We will embed linear mixed models within population genomic models that directly estimate X-linked ancestry \[Zhang et al. 2023\], improving statistical power over standard approaches. Sex-stratified analyses of more than 17,000 male and 5,500 female ASD cases will quantify X-linked heritability and test whether it is concentrated in the gene sets predicted by the drive hypothesis: spermatid/neuron overlap genes, XCI escapees, and selective sweep regions *\[selective sweep maybe to much popgen lingo. Use only a single memorable way to convay both that and hitchhiking\]*.

Second, we stratify the male cohort by the major Y haplogroups I and R (identified from diagnostic SNPs on the genotyping panel) and perform independent autosomal GWAS within each stratum. We will compute the genetic correlation for ASD between haplogroup I and haplogroup R males: a low correlation would be direct evidence that the two Y backgrounds create distinct genetic architectures for the same disorder. We will quantify missing heritability accounted for by epistatic effects of the Y chromosome using a Bayesian model that includes all nested haplogroups and accounts for non-independence by modelling their genealogical relationship.

As results from WP3 (chromatin analysis) become available, we will associate Y-haplotype-specific GWAS hits with genes at A/B compartment borders that are only accessible in either X- or Y-bearing spermatids to directly test whether the chromatin context explains haplogroup-dependent associations. Using *\[hitchhiking maybe to much popgen lingo\]* hitchhiking estimates from WP2, we will estimate the population-averaged polygenic risk score explained by hitchhiking-elevated frequencies of risk variants, quantifying the disease burden attributable to meiotic drive. Exploiting our access to UK Biobanks 500,000 fully sequenced participants, each with an ASD spectrum score, we will replicate our analyzes to quantify how sex chromosome conflicts influence the neurodevelopment across a general population.

Finally, integrating results across all four work packages, we will use the deep learning method (developed in WP4) to predict a male's polygenic risk score from autosomal and X-linked variants conditional on his Y chromosome repeat profile, thus moving from haplogroup categories to a continuous structural predictor.

**Work Package 2: Detection and characterization of X-linked meiotic drive.** While WP1 tests statistical predictions of the drive hypothesis in clinical data, WP2 seeks direct evidence of the drive mechanism and its evolutionary history. We will run genealogy-based selection scans on the X chromosome using tools that reconstruct the genealogical history of individual genomic regions from population samples. Exploiting my extensive expertise in this area, we will use both existing and newly devised genealogy statistics to identify genes subject to strong positive selection and to estimate the extent of the hitchhiking genomic neighorhood.

Using existing single-cell RNA sequencing data across spermatogenesis stages, we will cluster all X-linked genes by expression trajectory to isolate genes not suppressed by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and genes re-expressed after the meiotic division. Among these genes, we will identify candidate driver genes whos encoded products are not evenly distributed between X and Y-carrying spermatids - despite the active transport across cytoplasmic bridges connecting spermatids meant to ensure this.

For each ASD-associated variant (from WP1), we will estimate the change in allele frequency attributable to hitchhiking, and compute the GWAS effect size stratified by population frequency to estimate how much hitchhiking elevates the population-averaged polygenic risk score — directly quantifying the disease burden that drive imposes beyond what mutation-selection balance alone would produce.

The three-way arms race of Hypothesis 1 will apply to primates and in general. Exploiting my expertise in comparative genomics we will repeat the selection scans in 500 baboon genomes spanning six species of baboons. Eeach species represent a natural experiment presenting an independent realization of the process studied in humans. Identifying drivers shared by humans and baboons will will greatly bolster our confidence in individual candidate genes. Finding drivers unique to humans or baboons will support the proposed evolutionary mechanisms if such genes meet the expectations of Hypothesis 1.

**Work Package 3: 3D chromatin architecture in spermatogenesis.** This package provides the physical-chemistry dimension of the project, connecting the statistical genetic signals from WP1 and the evolutionary signals from WP2 to the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes in the nucleus. Hi-C (high-throughput chromosome conformation capture) measures the frequency of physical contact between every pair of genomic loci, providing a genome-wide map of chromosome folding. A fundamental feature of this organization is the division into A compartments (active, gene-rich, open chromatin) and B compartments (inactive, gene-poor, condensed). The boundaries between A and B compartments shift during spermatogenesis as chromatin is globally reorganized.

We will begin by reanalyzing published single-cell Hi-C data from human spermatogenesis, mapping A/B compartment boundaries at each stage using Bayesian changepoint detection — a method that provides posterior probability distributions over boundary positions rather than sharp calls. Pilot analysis already shows that selective sweep regions on the X significantly overlap compartment boundaries in spermatogonia (p = 0.017), pachytene spermatocytes (p = 0.006), round spermatids (p = 0.005), and spermatozoa (p = 0.028) \[Anonymized Reference 5\]. Differentially expressed genes between X- and Y-bearing spermatids are also enriched at these boundaries (p = 0.003) \[Anonymized References 5, 6\].

We will identify topologically associating domains (TADs) affected at A/B borders — self-interacting chromatin neighborhoods that constrain gene regulation — and characterize superloop structures that span compartments on the X. These large-scale chromatin loops (mediated by CTCF binding at loci such as DXZ4 and FIRRE) may enable genes in B compartments to access the transcriptional environment of A compartments, providing a structural route for MSCI escape.

Linking to the Y chromosome story: using a recently published single-cell ATAC-seq atlas of the human brain \[Caglayan et al. 2024\], which profiles chromatin accessibility across cell types in individuals with known Y haplogroup, we will test whether Y haplogroup influences X-linked and autosomal chromatin structure in neural tissue. If the sink model is correct, haplogroup I males should show systematically altered accessibility at euchromatin–heterochromatin boundaries. This would bridge the spermatogenesis-focused chromatin analysis with the clinical phenotype in brain.

**Work Package 4: Y chromosome repeat content and prediction.** The Y chromosome harbours large families of duplicated genes — ampliconic genes — arranged in palindromic repeat structures. These multi-copy gene families (including DAZ, CDY, RBMY, and TSPY) are essential for spermatogenesis, and their copy number varies substantially between individual men and between Y haplogroups. While WP1 uses categorical haplogroup assignments as a proxy for Y structure, this package directly characterizes the continuous variation in Y chromosome composition and develops machine learning methods to exploit it.

First, we will systematically profile ampliconic gene copy numbers and repeat content across the fully sequenced Y chromosomes now available in the UK Biobank, creating a comprehensive map of Y structural variation at population scale. This goes beyond the 43 telomere-to-telomere assemblies from Rhie et al. 2023 to thousands of individuals, enabling population-level statistical analysis.

Second, using the genealogical methods from WP2, we will characterize positive and negative selection acting on ampliconic gene counts and repeat content — testing whether certain copy-number configurations are favored or disfavored, and whether selection on Y repeat content connects to the meiotic drive dynamics detected on the X. If the sink model is correct, Y haplogroups with greater heterochromatin content may experience selection through their epistatic effects on autosomal gene expression — a form of indirect selection that has not previously been characterized in humans.

Third, we will develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes a Y chromosome's repeat and ampliconic gene profile as input and predicts chromatin compartment status (A or B) at the compartment borders identified in WP3. Standard linear models cannot capture the complex, nonlinear relationship between the high-dimensional repeat landscape of the Y and chromatin state elsewhere in the genome. A CNN trained on paired Y-structure and chromatin-state data can learn these relationships end-to-end. Successful prediction would provide the strongest evidence that Y structural variation causally influences genome-wide chromatin organization, and would enable individual-level prediction of which genomic regions are epigenetically exposed — the key input to the Y-conditional risk scoring developed in WP1.

### Creativity, Ambition, and Originality

Three aspects of this project are genuinely new. First, it proposes that intragenomic conflict — a fundamental evolutionary force studied primarily in model organisms — has direct, quantifiable consequences for a specific human disorder. Meiotic drive has never been connected to human disease in this way. The prediction that selfish sex-linked genes continuously generate ASD-relevant variation represents a new explanatory framework, distinct from the standard model in which disease variants are maintained by mutation-selection balance alone.

Second, it introduces the Y chromosome as an active modulator of autosomal gene expression and ASD risk through chromatin regulation. The Y has been entirely absent from ASD genetics. If haplogroup-dependent epistasis proves real, it would provide a mechanistic basis for the male bias of ASD beyond simple X-linkage, and would explain a measurable fraction of ASD's "missing heritability" — the gap between estimated total heritability and what current GWAS variants explain.

Third, the project bridges evolutionary population genetics, comparative primate genomics, 3D chromatin biology, deep learning, and psychiatric cohort analysis — fields that rarely interact. The replication of selection scans across humans and other primates tests the generality of the conflict, while clinical cohort work tests its medical significance. The methods developed here — X-chromosome GWAS frameworks, Y-stratified heritability models, genealogical statistics for transient drive, and CNN-based chromatin prediction from Y profiles — will be applicable to any complex trait with sex bias.

### Why This Project Requires the NERD Format

This project is difficult to fund through conventional programs for two reasons — one sociological, one structural. In molecular evolution, there is a widespread but arguably irrational reluctance to accept meiotic drive as an important force in human or primate evolution, despite the fact that it follows as a logical consequence from well-accepted premises about the mechanisms of selection. The situation is analogous to the Higgs boson in physics: given the accumulated theoretical framework, the particle had to exist, yet demonstrating it required a scale of investment that only became possible when the community trusted the logic enough to build a giant accelerator. Similarly, if current models of sex-linked selection are correct, meiotic drive must operate — and the evidence trail connecting it to human disease will only emerge from a project that is large enough to pursue all the converging lines simultaneously. A conventional grant supporting one work package at a time would not generate the critical mass of evidence needed to shift a skeptical field.

The structural reason is equally decisive. The project draws on population genomics, GWAS methodology, chromatin biology, Hi-C, comparative primate genomics, deep learning, and psychiatric genetics — fields that rarely share personnel. Testing the hypothesis requires sustained expertise in all of them. The work could in principle be done sequentially over a decade by a single investigator, but this would make it nearly impossible to recruit strong postdocs, because their individual projects would not yield the high-impact, multi-disciplinary papers that competitive postdoctoral researchers need. The only viable strategy is to run all four work packages concurrently, so that each postdoc's project receives real-time input from parallel projects, and so that all participants can contribute to — and benefit from — the cross-cutting papers that combine evidence from multiple work packages. The NERD program's support for concentrated, long-term work on an unconventional idea is precisely what makes this strategy feasible.

### Future Applications in Life Sciences / Health Sciences

Recognizing that evolutionary conflict on the sex chromosomes shapes ASD risk could identify new risk genes and pathways invisible to current approaches. Y-haplotype-stratified polygenic risk scores may improve ASD risk prediction in males — one of the first applications of sex chromosome structural variation in clinical genomics. The CNN-based prediction framework, which maps Y chromosome structure to chromatin state, could enable stratification of ASD into subtypes with distinct etiologies — a prerequisite for any future precision-medicine approach. The X chromosome GWAS methods developed here will be broadly useful for any GWAS — most current studies claiming "genome-wide" coverage exclude the X entirely. More broadly, the project establishes a framework for understanding how intragenomic conflict contributes to human disease, with potential relevance to other sex-biased conditions including ADHD, schizophrenia, and autoimmune disorders.

## 4. LAY PROJECT DESCRIPTION (max 1,000 characters)

Autism is four times more common in boys than girls, yet no genetic explanation exists for this sex difference. We propose that evolutionary competition between the sex chromosomes contributes to autism risk. On the X chromosome, gene variants that help sperm compete spread through populations even when they slightly impair brain development — an evolutionary conflict between reproduction and neurodevelopment. On the Y chromosome, structural differences between male lineages may alter which autism risk genes are switched on. By combining evolutionary genetics, large clinical datasets with more than 22,000 autism cases, and primate genome comparisons, this project aims to uncover how sex chromosome conflict shapes the genetic basis of autism and its male bias.

## NOTES FOR DISCUSSION

1.  **v6 changes from v5:** Research Plan rewritten to match restructured 4-WP plan from WP_detailed_plans.md. Key changes: (a) WP1 now explicitly follows the 8-item plan with Bayesian haplogroup model, genetic correlation, and cross-WP links to A/B compartments and hitchhiking PRS; (b) WP2 adds SINGER alongside Relate, and includes explicit computation of PRS inflation from hitchhiking; (c) WP3 specifies single-cell Hi-C reanalysis and adds scATAC-seq brain atlas reference \[Caglayan et al. 2024\]; (d) WP4 completely rewritten — now focused on Y chromosome ampliconic gene profiling, selection on repeat content, and deep CNN for TAD chromatin prediction from Y profiles (replaces old evolutionary modeling + clinical prediction package). Formal population genetic modeling is now distributed across WP1 (Bayesian heritability, PRS methods) and WP2 (genealogical statistics, hitchhiking quantification). Added CNN, TAD, scATAC-seq, XWAS to abbreviations.

2.  **Audience calibration (carried from v5):** Written for Committee for Natural and Technical Sciences — physicists, chemists, mathematicians, engineers. Every biological term defined on first use; methodology framed in terms of statistical/mathematical approaches.

3.  **Anonymity risks:** The Skov et al. 2023 paper is co-authored by the applicant. The specific combination of meiotic drive + X chromosome + autism + Danish cohort could be identifying. Anonymized references must be handled carefully.

4.  **Balance of risk:** WP1 and WP2 are well-supported by converging pilot data. The Y chromosome story (WP1 Y-stratification, WP3 pericentromeric boundary enrichment, WP4 CNN prediction) is higher-risk but fits the NERD "exploratory" ethos.
