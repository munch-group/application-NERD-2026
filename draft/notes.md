The reader may wonder why drive has not been reported in humans and that it seems at odds the lack of evidence of transmission distortion and sex-of-offspring bias in humans: Drive is likely transient and that each driver may only produce a distortion in competitions with particular Y chromosomes and on particular autosomal backgrounds. So while each driver may strongly distort on some backgrounds its average distortion across backgrounds is often will quickly diminish or or disappear as the population allele frequencies will calibrate in favour of an average even transmission. However, before it does, the driver itself will have reached high frequency along with its hitchhiking surroundings, with the associated collateral effects.
