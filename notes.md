Since the grant is meant for projects that require continuous concentrated work on an unusual idea, I think it make sense to make sure it is clear that applies to this project. The project pulls from very different areas: ASD, GWAS, Neurobiology, Chromatin, HiC, Population genomics, modelling. Testing the hypothesis requires progress expertise in all these areas. I could do all the projects in sequence over the next 10 years, but it would be very hard to recruit postdocs, since their individual projects would not be able to yield the high impact papers that good postdocs expect. The only solution is to do it all simultaneously, so that the project led by each postdoc can can receive input from parallel projects and so that all participants can be coauthors on the high impact papers pulling from multiple work packages.

I also need to argue that this project will be difficult to get funded through more conventional funding programs. In the fields of  molecular evolution, there is a strange irrational reluctance to accept meiotic drive as an important mechanism in human or primate molecular evolution. The way I see it, it is a bit like the Higgs boson in physics: Given the accumulated knowledge about the mechnaisms of selection, and if everything everybody believes to be true about molecular evolution, then it follows as a logic consequence that sex-chromosome meiotic drive is an active force in all species with sex chromosomes. This project is driven by the same kind of trust in logic that physicists build giant accelerators.
