## 2. BRIEF PROJECT DESCRIPTION (max 2,000 characters)

*Stand-alone summary of purpose and key activities. Must be anonymous.*

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects nearly 3% of children in Denmark and shows a striking 4:1 male-to-female ratio that remains unexplained. This project proposes that both sex chromosomes actively contribute to ASD risk through distinct evolutionary mechanisms — the X chromosome through meiotic drive and the Y chromosome through heterochromatin-mediated gene regulation — and that understanding these mechanisms will transform our knowledge of ASD's genetic architecture.

On the X chromosome, selfish gene variants escape meiotic sex chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis, gaining a transmission advantage even when the same variants are mildly deleterious for brain development. Because one in four neuron genes is also expressed in spermatids, this intragenomic conflict continuously pumps ASD-relevant variation into human populations. On the Y chromosome, haplogroups carrying different amounts of heterochromatin may differentially sequester chromatin-modifying proteins, creating haplogroup-dependent epistatic landscapes that modulate ASD penetrance.

The project will (1) develop population genomic methods to detect ongoing meiotic drive in humans, (2) perform the first systematic X chromosome association study of ASD using large clinical cohorts, (3) test whether Y chromosome haplogroups modulate autosomal and X-linked ASD risk, and (4) build evolutionary models integrating sex chromosome conflict with neurodevelopmental disease. The project combines methodology from evolutionary genomics with clinical cohort data, addressing questions that fall between traditional disciplines.

## 3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION — DETAILED OUTLINE (max 30,000 characters)

*This is the make-or-break section. Only content seen in the anonymous Stage 1 review.*

### Section 1: Introduction and Big Question (\~4,000 chars)

**Opening hook:** The 4:1 male excess in ASD is one of the most robust findings in psychiatric genetics, yet its explanation remains elusive. Despite the X chromosome explaining 20% of neuro-anatomical variation relevant to ASD \[Mallard et al. 2021\] while constituting only 5% of the genome, most genome-wide association studies have excluded the X chromosome from analysis due to its complex inheritance pattern.

**The selfish gene framework:** Introduce the concept of intragenomic conflict. Sex chromosomes are a unique arena for evolutionary arms races because X and Y compete for transmission. An X-linked gene variant can promote its own transmission by killing Y-bearing sperm cells or by escaping meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) — both forms of meiotic drive. Such selfish behavior has been documented across vertebrates, insects, fungi, and plants \[Zanders & Unckless 2019\], and recent evidence suggests it operates in humans as well \[Anonymized Reference 1\].

**The neglected sex chromosomes:** Despite their outsized role in neurodevelopment, both X and Y chromosomes have been systematically excluded from studies of ASD genetics. The X is excluded from GWAS due to dosage complications; the Y is ignored entirely. This project aims to fill this gap by investigating how evolutionary forces acting on both sex chromosomes shape ASD risk.

**The core proposal:** This project will test the hypothesis that intragenomic conflict on the sex chromosomes — meiotic drive on the X and heterochromatin-mediated regulation by the Y — is a major unrecognized contributor to the genetic architecture of ASD and its male bias.

### Section 2: Background — The X Chromosome and Meiotic Drive (\~5,000 chars)

**Recurrent selective sweeps on the human X:** The human X chromosome shows a unique pattern of recurrent bursts of strong natural selection, most recently at 45,000–55,000 BP, where strong selection at fourteen loci dramatically affected allele frequencies for 10% of the chromosome \[Anonymized Reference 1\]. The scale of this phenomenon is exclusive to the X chromosome and strongly suggests selection on gene function in male spermatogenesis.

**The neuron/spermatid overlap:** A proteomic comparison shows that 80% of brain proteins are also found in testis \[Matos et al. 2021\]. More specifically, 24–25% of neuron genes are also expressed in male spermatids. This overlap creates the conditions for an evolutionary conflict: variants selected for their role in spermatogenesis may have collateral effects on brain development.

**The dosage-conflict hypothesis:** MSCI and somatic X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females likely evolved from the same highly conserved mechanism of un-synapsed chromatin silencing \[Hornecker et al. 2007\]. Supporting this, super-loops established by CTCF binding at the XIST, FIRRE, and DXZ4 loci are crucial to proper X inactivation, and DXZ4 has been shown to function as a speciation gene in cats through its effect on MSCI — demonstrating that the same loci control both silencing mechanisms. If selfish genes escape MSCI in males, they are likely to also escape XCI in females. Because the X spends two-thirds of its time in females and one-third in males, selection will favor resolution through reduced female expression. This leads to dosage deficiency in males — a direct path to male-specific neurodevelopmental risk.

**The hitchhiking hypothesis:** ASD risk variants near genes under strong meiotic drive are expected to "hitchhike" to higher population frequency than equivalent variants on autosomes. On a non-recombining chromosome, an allele linked to a driver will increase in frequency even if it is mildly deleterious. Because recombination on the X chromosome is restricted to females (the X does not recombine in males), linked selection is particularly effective — and this is compounded by the X chromosome's smaller effective population size (3/4 of autosomes). The hitchhiking model predicts a positive correlation between the strength of local selection and the population frequency of ASD risk alleles, a prediction directly testable in clinical cohort data.

**Convergent evidence from comparative genomics:** The tubulin-modifying enzyme TTLL11 has been independently inactivated in both humans and gorillas, but remains functional in chimpanzees. TTLL11 polyglutamylates tubulin and is required for directional sperm motility; knockout mice produce sperm that swim in circles. One hypothesis is that TTLL11 inactivation evolved as a defense against an X-linked meiotic driver that co-opted TTLL11-dependent microtubule transport across spermatid bridges to create segregation distortion. This convergent inactivation in two great ape lineages — both with low sperm competition — illustrates how meiotic drive can leave deep evolutionary signatures in the genome.

**Preliminary evidence (anonymized):** Pilot analyses using MAGMA on a large clinical cohort yield results consistent with each prediction of the dosage-conflict hypothesis. In males, neuron genes co-expressed in spermatids are significantly enriched for ASD association (p = 0.030, β = 0.14), whereas neuron genes without spermatid expression show no enrichment — confirming that it is specifically the dual-expressed genes that carry risk. ASD association in males is also elevated among genes escaping female XCI (p = 0.027, β = 0.03), consistent with MSCI-escape genes also escaping XCI. In females, ASD association is concentrated among gametologs — candidate meiotic driver genes with a Y chromosome homolog (p = 0.026, β = 0.45) \[Anonymized Reference 2\]. Gene Ontology analysis reveals that the neuron+spermatid overlap genes are enriched for cytosol genes (44% enrichment) and extracellular exosome genes (2-fold), while chromatin regulators are conspicuously absent from this set — suggesting the conflict acts primarily through cytoplasmic transport and signalling rather than transcriptional regulation. Among the dual-expressed genes, several are both XCI-escapers and differentially expressed between spermatogenesis stages: DDX3X, HUWE1, UBA1, SYAP1, and FMR1 — each with known roles in neurodevelopment \[Anonymized Reference 2\].

An independent analysis using the Relate genealogy method on 1000 Genomes data identified 35 positively selected genes on the X chromosome, of which 9 are ASD-associated (Fisher's exact test, p = 5.95 × 10⁻⁵). Positive selection was significantly more common in genes active in both spermatids and brain compared to brain-only genes (p = 0.002) \[Anonymized Reference 3\].

**Stage-resolved expression identifies MSCI escapees:** Single-cell RNA expression data through spermatogenesis allows identification of X-linked genes that are expressed post-meiotically — genes that must have escaped or reactivated after MSCI. These MSCI escapees are the direct candidates for meiotic drive, because post-meiotic expression is required for a gene to influence its own transmission. Critically, this provides a far more precise test of the meiotic drive hypothesis than bulk tissue annotations: rather than asking whether a gene is expressed "in testis," we can ask whether it is expressed specifically in round spermatids or spermatozoa — the cell types where drive operates.

**ASD genes are differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing spermatids:** Analysis of single-cell RNA data reveals that known ASD genes from the SFARI database are significantly enriched among genes differentially expressed between X-carrying and Y-carrying spermatids (p = 0.004) \[Anonymized Reference 6\]. This is a particularly compelling result because post-meiotic spermatids share cytoplasm through intercellular bridges, meaning most transcripts are distributed equally between cell types. Genes that nonetheless show differential expression must act cell-autonomously or be regulated by the sex chromosome complement itself. The enrichment of ASD genes among these differentially expressed genes provides direct evidence that the molecular distinction between X- and Y-bearing spermatids — the very distinction on which meiotic drive operates — disproportionately involves genes relevant to neurodevelopment. Furthermore, X chromosome genes differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing spermatids are significantly enriched at A/B compartment borders (p = 0.003) \[Anonymized References 5, 6\], connecting the expression-level evidence directly to the 3D chromatin architecture: the genes that distinguish X- from Y-bearing spermatids are located precisely at the chromatin boundaries where meiotic silencing is reorganized.

**Convergence on five candidate meiotic drivers:** Intersecting three independent gene sets — SFARI ASD genes, genes under recent positive selection (Relate), and genes differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing spermatids — identifies five genes present in all three sets: CDKL5, CLCN4, HUWE1, IL1RAPL1, and PTCHD1 \[Anonymized References 3, 6\]. Each of these is a well-established X-linked ASD gene. CDKL5 encodes a kinase essential for neuronal synapse formation whose mutations cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder; HUWE1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase critical for brain development; IL1RAPL1 regulates synapse formation and is one of the most frequently disrupted genes in ASD; PTCHD1 is involved in Hedgehog signalling and is among the best-replicated X-linked ASD risk genes; CLCN4 encodes a chloride channel implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. That these five genes are simultaneously under positive selection, differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing spermatids, and associated with ASD is precisely what the meiotic drive hypothesis predicts: they are candidate selfish genes whose transmission advantage in spermatogenesis comes at a cost to neurodevelopment.

**3D chromatin architecture links selection to spermatogenesis:** Analysis of Hi-C data from macaque spermatogenesis stages reveals that the selective sweep regions (ECH90 regions from \[Anonymized Reference 1\]) significantly overlap A/B compartment borders — the boundaries between active and inactive chromatin domains — specifically in spermatogonia (p = 0.017), pachytene spermatocytes (p = 0.006), round spermatids (p = 0.005), and in human spermatozoa (p = 0.028) \[Anonymized Reference 5\]. This overlap is consistent with the hypothesis that selfish X-linked genes escape meiotic silencing by exploiting the chromatin reorganization that occurs at compartment boundaries during spermatogenesis. A Bayesian method has been developed to precisely locate A/B compartment borders, enabling fine-scale mapping of the relationship between selection and chromatin architecture \[Anonymized Reference 5\].

### Section 3: Background — The Y Chromosome and Chromatin Regulation (\~4,000 chars)

**The heterochromatin sink model:** The Y chromosome is the most intensively studied heterochromatin sink. In Drosophila, adding or removing Y chromosomes causes measurable genome-wide redistribution of H3K9me2/3 at pericentromeric regions \[Brown et al. 2020\]. The mechanism involves mass-action competition: key chromatin proteins (HP1, SUV39H) exist in limiting quantities and are titrated by heterochromatic DNA.

**Human Y haplogroup variation:** Recent assembly of 43 human Y chromosomes \[Rhie et al. 2023\] reveals substantial structural differences between haplogroups. The centromeric α-satellite arrays show \>2-fold size differences (haplogroup R1b: mean 341 kbp; haplogroup I: mean 787 kbp). The DYZ1 satellite repeat varies over an order of magnitude (7–98 Mbp) and correlates with haplogroup membership.

**Chromatin regulation in ASD:** Chromatin remodelling has emerged as a central pathway in ASD genetics. Genome-wide analyses have identified numerous ASD candidate genes encoding nuclear factors implicated in chromatin remodelling, histone demethylation, histone variants, and DNA demethylation recognition. High-confidence ASD risk genes include CHD8 (an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that binds H3K4me3 and regulates other ASD risk genes), KDM5C (a histone demethylase that removes active H3K4me3 marks), SETD5 (a histone methyltransferase), and ADNP, CHD2, POGZ, and KMT5B \[De Rubeis et al. 2014\]. Crucially, disruption of the H3K4me3 landscape has been directly observed in autism frontal cortex samples. If Y haplogroup heterochromatin content modulates the nuclear availability of these chromatin-modifying proteins, it could create haplogroup-dependent epistatic landscapes for ASD risk.

**Predictions for haplogroup I vs R:** Haplogroup I, with its higher heterochromatin content, is predicted to cause greater sequestration of HP1, SUV39H, and H3K9 methyltransferase, leading to reduced autosomal heterochromatin formation at pericentromeric regions and increased chromatin accessibility at normally silenced regions. Haplogroup R, with lower heterochromatin, should maintain stronger autosomal heterochromatin and more defined euchromatin–heterochromatin boundaries. Most Danish men carry a Y chromosome from either the I or the R haplogroup, making a Danish clinical cohort an ideal testing ground.

**Preliminary evidence (Anonymized):** Stratifying males in a large clinical ASD cohort by their Y chromosome haplogroup (I vs R) reveals that different autosomal SNPs reach significance depending on haplogroup background \[Anonymized Reference 4\]. This suggests context-dependent epistasis mediated by Y chromosome chromatin state — precisely what the sink model predicts.

**Caveat and opportunity:** While the heterochromatin sink is well-established in Drosophila, its relevance in mammals is debated. In Drosophila, XYY males and XXY females show dramatic reduction of H3K9me2/3 enrichment at repeat-rich regions, and boundaries between heterochromatic pericentromere and euchromatic chromosome arms become blurred with additional Y chromosome material \[Brown et al. 2020\]. Whether the same mechanism operates in humans, or whether mammalian Y chromosomes modulate autosomal expression through different pathways (e.g., ZFX/ZFY transcription factors), remains an open question. Testing this directly in human ASD cohorts represents a high-risk, high-reward component of the project — exactly the kind of exploratory science the NERD programme is designed to support.

### Section 4: Research Plan (\~10,000 chars)

#### Work Package 1: The X Chromosome — Detecting Meiotic Drive and Its Consequences (Years 1–4)

**WP1.1: X chromosome GWAS in clinical cohorts** - Develop population genomic methods sensitive to rare X-linked variants by embedding standard linear mixed models for GWAS in population genomic models of cohort ancestry \[Zhang et al. 2023\], directly modelling ancestry along the X chromosome to increase power over standard imputation - Run sex-stratified GWAS on a large clinical cohort with \>17,000 male cases and \>5,500 female cases, using both dosage-based and hard-call genotypes to evaluate the impact of dosage compensation modelling - Estimate ASD heritability on the X chromosome using stratified LD score regression (LDSC-SEG) and partition heritability across nested gene sets: spermatid/neuron overlap, XCI escapees, gametologs, genes in selective sweep regions - Build X-linked polygenic risk scores (PRS) and test whether they add predictive power beyond autosomal PRS — quantifying what the field misses by excluding the X chromosome - Test the hitchhiking prediction: use RELATE and CLUES to compute the likelihood ratio of positive selection at each X-linked SNP, then evaluate the expected positive correlation between selection strength and risk-allele frequency - Pool data with unexploited X chromosome data from PGC and SPARK cohorts to increase sample size and population diversity

**WP1.2: Identifying MSCI escapees and detecting meiotic drive** - Use single-cell RNA expression data across spermatogenesis to identify X-linked genes with post-meiotic expression (MSCI escapees) - Test whether MSCI escapees are enriched for ASD-associated genes (SFARI, iPSYCH GWAS hits) - Cross-reference with positively selected genes from Relate analysis and SFARI ASD genes: preliminary analysis identifies five genes in the triple overlap (differentially expressed in X/Y spermatids + under positive selection + ASD-associated): CDKL5, CLCN4, HUWE1, IL1RAPL1, and PTCHD1 — each a well-established X-linked ASD gene \[Anonymized Reference 6\]. These are the strongest meiotic driver candidates - Apply genealogy-based methods (Relate, ARG inference) to X chromosome data from multiple population datasets - Characterize expression trajectories of candidate genes through spermatogenesis stages — genes showing silencing during pachytene followed by reactivation in spermatids provide direct evidence of MSCI escape
<!-- This work package should also replicate selection scans in macaques and baboons to see if the same gene sets are repeatedly targeted by strong positive selection. It should also include a functional characterization of driver candidates and involvement in Selective/Directional transport across cytoplasmic bridges between X and Y spermatids. Uneven distribution of mitochondria to X an Y carrying spermatids. Differential storage of mRNA in chromatoid bodies
-->

**WP1.4: 3D chromatin architecture and meiotic drive** - Analyze Hi-C data across spermatogenesis stages to characterize how A/B compartment borders relate to selfish gene regions - Apply Bayesian compartment border detection to precisely map boundaries in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa - Test whether genes escaping MSCI cluster at compartment boundaries — providing a mechanistic link between chromatin reorganization and meiotic drive - Extend analysis to human spermatogenesis Hi-C data as these datasets become available - Compare compartment dynamics between X and autosomes during meiosis
<!-- Characterize properties of candidate genes located at fluid A/B compartment borders.

-->

**WP1.3: The neuron/spermatid conflict — autosomal impact** - 
<!-- 
Include scans for selection on the autosome using publicly available 1000 genomes data. See if autosomal genes functionally linked to X or Y linked genes are enriched for selection as would be expected if these continually compensate for the transmission distortion effect of drivers.
Estimate pathogenicity of mutation segregating variants. Do genes involved in spermatogenesis accumulate more pathogenic variants?
Investigate if autosomal genes may be co-opted by candidate drivers more often lost to in-frame stop codons?
 -->
Characterize the gene functions and pathways shared between spermatids and neurons that are under selection. Preliminary GO analysis shows enrichment for cytosol and extracellular exosome genes, suggesting the conflict operates through cytoplasmic transport and signalling pathways - Focus on the Doublecortin (DCX) family: DCX is the master X-linked regulator of neuronal migration (through microtubule stabilization) and is also required for sperm motility. It shows strong recent selection and is associated with ASD, making it a prime case study for the conflict hypothesis - Investigate TTLL11 inactivation as a model for how organisms defend against meiotic drive. TTLL11 modifies tubulin through polyglutamylation and is required for directional sperm swimming. Its independent inactivation in humans and gorillas — but not chimpanzees — may represent convergent defenses against an X-linked driver that exploited tubulin-dependent transport across spermatid bridges - Use multivariate PGS regression to test for differential genetic load across ASD subtypes, evaluating whether the meiotic drive gene set explains phenotypic variation within the autism spectrum - Investigate the X-linked intercellular bridge transport genes (including those in the tubulin code) as potential driver or driver-interacting candidates


#### Work Package 2: The Y Chromosome — Haplogroup-Dependent Epistasis (Years 2–5)

**WP2.3: Haplogroup-specific pathway and network analysis** - Map haplogroup-specific gene lists to GO terms, KEGG pathways, and Reactome, focusing on chromatin modification, synaptic function, and neurodevelopmental pathways - Test whether genes significant in different haplogroup backgrounds converge on the same pathways despite being different genes — evidence for the same biology being affected through different chromatin routes - Build haplogroup-specific PRS and test for improved ASD risk prediction vs. unstratified models - Assess the implications for "missing heritability": what fraction of heritability that appears missing in a combined analysis is recovered when stratifying by Y haplogroup?

#### Work Package 3: Evolutionary Modelling (Years 3–6)

**WP3.1: Population genetic models of the neuron/spermatid conflict** - Develop formal population genetic models of X-linked meiotic drive with pleiotropic effects on neurodevelopment, parameterising the transmission ratio distortion, the fitness cost in brain function, and the frequency-dependent dynamics - Model the steady-state ASD risk generated by the evolutionary pump: given realistic parameters for drive strength and fitness costs, what equilibrium frequency of ASD-relevant variation does the conflict maintain? - Predict the expected polygenic architecture under the conflict model vs. neutral expectations: the model should predict excess common variation at dual-expressed genes, higher risk-allele frequencies near selected loci, and an enrichment of ASD association on the X chromosome — all testable predictions - Compute the expected increase in population-averaged polygenic risk for ASD when selective sweep regions rose to high frequency (as occurred during the 45–55 kBP sweep episode)
<!-- - Quantify PGS contributed by autosomal genes whose A/B status in males is determined by Y haplotype. See if these account for the higher prevalence in I and R haplotype males.
Estimate detrimental effect of variants. See how many causal variants on the X chromosome have hitchhiked to frequencies much higher than their detrimental effect would predict (suggesting that meiotic drive trumps the detrimental neurodevelopmental effect). -->


<!-- KM: This does not seem feasible. Remove to make room for other work packages -->
**WP3.2: Simulation of chromatin factor titration** - Build stochastic simulations of chromatin factor (HP1, SUV39H, H3K9 methyltransferase) distribution across nuclear compartments, varying the heterochromatin load to match haplogroup I vs R - Predict which genomic regions are most affected by factor depletion and compare with the empirically observed haplogroup-specific association signals from WP2 - Model boundary effects: how sharp are the predicted euchromatin–heterochromatin transitions under different factor concentrations, and do the empirical T2T annotations match?

<!-- KM: This does not seem feasible. Remove to make room for other work packages -->

Could help isolate sub-types of ASD with separate etiologies with the prospect of better and earlier support of ASD children and potentially development of drugs targeted to subtypes (E.g. Lamotrigine, Oxytocin) -->

### Section 5: Creativity, Ambition, and Originality (\~2,000 chars)

This project is original in three ways:

First, it proposes that intragenomic conflict — a fundamental evolutionary force — has direct consequences for human disease. While meiotic drive has been studied extensively in model organisms, no one has connected it to a specific human disorder. The idea that selfish X-linked genes continuously pump ASD-relevant variation into human populations represents a paradigm shift in understanding the genetic architecture of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Second, it introduces the Y chromosome as an active modulator of ASD risk through chromatin regulation. The Y has been entirely ignored in ASD genetics. If haplogroup-dependent epistasis proves real, it would explain a substantial portion of ASD's "missing heritability" and provide a mechanistic basis for its male bias beyond simple X-linkage.

Third, it bridges evolutionary genomics and psychiatric genetics — two fields that rarely interact. The methods and conceptual framework developed here will be applicable to any complex trait with sex bias (ADHD, schizophrenia, anorexia, depression).

### Section 6: Future Applications in Life Sciences / Health Sciences (\~2,000 chars)

*Required by NERD guidelines — separate paragraph.*

The proposed research has potential future applications across several domains:

**Understanding ASD aetiology:** By revealing how evolutionary forces on sex chromosomes shape ASD risk, this project could identify new classes of risk genes and pathways that current approaches miss entirely.

**Improved genetic risk prediction:** Haplogroup-stratified polygenic risk scores may substantially improve ASD risk prediction in males. If validated, this would represent one of the first examples of incorporating sex chromosome variation into clinical genomics.

**Informing GWAS methodology:** The X chromosome association methods developed here will be broadly useful, enabling systematic inclusion of X-linked markers in GWAS of any trait. This addresses a major gap in the field — the X chromosome is routinely excluded from studies that claim to be "genome-wide."

**Evolutionary medicine:** The project establishes a new framework for understanding how intragenomic conflict contributes to human disease, applicable to other sex-biased disorders including ADHD, schizophrenia, and autoimmune conditions.

**Diagnostics and support:** Understanding the X chromosome's disproportionate contribution to ASD is crucial for improved diagnosis and support of neuro-divergent individuals, particularly as the proportion diagnosed in Denmark approaches 3%.

## 4. LAY PROJECT DESCRIPTION (max 1,000 characters)

Autism is increasingly common, affecting nearly 3% of Danish children, and is four times more prevalent in boys than girls. This sex difference remains unexplained. This project investigates whether "selfish" genes on the sex chromosomes contribute to autism risk. On the X chromosome, gene variants that enhance sperm production spread through populations even when they mildly impair brain development. On the Y chromosome, structural differences between lineages may alter which autism risk genes become active. By combining evolutionary genetics with analysis of large clinical datasets, this project aims to uncover new genetic mechanisms underlying autism and its male bias.

1.  **Framing priority:** The project is framed as fundamental evolutionary genomics (natural science) with applications in health — not as biomedicine. This keeps it within NERD scope.

2.  **Anonymity risks:** The Skov et al. 2023 paper is co-authored by Kasper. The iPSYCH connection and the specific combination of meiotic drive + X chromosome + autism + Danish cohort could be identifying. We need to ensure Anonymized references are handled carefully. The specific MAGMA p-values and gene lists could also narrow the field.

3.  **Balance of risk:** WP1 (X chromosome) is now very well-supported by five converging lines of preliminary data: (a) MAGMA enrichments, (b) Relate selection scan, (c) scRNA-seq SFARI enrichment, (d) Hi-C compartment borders, (e) differential expression in X- vs Y-bearing spermatids. WP2 (Y chromosome) is higher-risk but fits the NERD "exploratory" ethos. WP3 (modelling) provides a safety net.

4.  **Personnel from Notion "People" page:**

    - Shannon D'Urso (current postdoc, Lundbeck-funded through \~2025, works on exactly this topic)
    - Erik Fogh Sørensen (former PhD student, X chromosome evolution and hybrid incompatibilities)
    - Søren Jørgensen (former master student, Hi-C/chromatin architecture — source of Anonymized Reference 5)
    - Budget should cover: 1-2 PhD students, 1-2 postdocs (after Shannon's current funding ends), computing, travel

5.  **Remaining questions for Kasper:**

    - ~~P-value for the SFARI enrichment in X- vs Y-bearing spermatid DEGs?~~ → p = 0.004 (added)
    - Is the differential expression primarily X-linked genes, autosomal, or both?
    - Specific budget details (personnel plan, computing needs)
    - Any additional collaborations to mention (Anonymized)
    - Preferred title option?

## PILOT RESULT WISHLIST (updated 13 Feb 2026)

*Prioritized by impact on the application × feasibility before 19 Feb deadline.*

### Already in the draft (confirmed results)

- ✅ MAGMA enrichments: neuron+spermatid p=0.030, XCI escape p=0.027, gametologs p=0.026
- ✅ Relate: 9/35 selected genes are ASD-associated, p=5.95×10⁻⁵; spermatid+brain vs brain-only p=0.002
- ✅ SFARI ASD genes enriched among X/Y spermatid DEGs, p=0.004
- ✅ X/Y spermatid DEGs enriched at A/B compartment borders, p=0.003
- ✅ ECH90 selective sweeps overlap A/B borders in spermatogenesis stages, p=0.005–0.028
- ✅ Y haplogroup stratification (I vs R) affects GWAS associations (qualitative)
- ✅ Triple-overlap Venn diagram: 5 genes (CDKL5, CLCN4, HUWE1, IL1RAPL1, PTCHD1) in all three sets (SFARI × selection × X/Y spermatid DEGs). All pairwise overlaps significant (***,***,\*\*). Figure produced.

### Tier 1 — High impact, likely feasible before deadline

**1. ✅ DONE — Triple-overlap Venn diagram** (for Figure 2) Result: 5 genes in triple overlap: CDKL5, CLCN4, HUWE1, IL1RAPL1, PTCHD1. All pairwise overlaps significant. Figure produced. Better than expected — 5 genes, all well-known ASD genes.

**2. Expression trajectory plots for top candidates** (for Figure 2) Data needed: scRNA-seq expression values across spermatogenesis stages for candidate genes Analysis: Plot expression of e.g. CASK, HUWE1, CDKL5, FRMPD4, DDX3X across spermatogonia → leptotene → pachytene → round spermatid → spermatozoa Why it matters: If these genes show the signature pattern (expression → silencing at pachytene → reactivation in spermatids), that is visual proof of MSCI escape. Intuitive even for non-specialists. Effort: Low-moderate — data is processed, need to extract and plot specific genes.

**3. Haplogroup-specific hits near euchromatin–heterochromatin boundaries** (strengthens WP2) Data needed: Y-stratified GWAS results (already have), T2T-CHM13 pericentromeric boundary annotations Analysis: Test whether haplogroup I-specific significant SNPs are enriched near pericentromeric boundaries compared to haplogroup R-specific SNPs. Why it matters: Directly tests the sink model's key prediction. A significant enrichment would transform WP2 from "promising idea" to "supported hypothesis." Effort: Moderate — need to define boundaries from T2T and run enrichment on existing GWAS output.

**4. Haplogroup-specific hits in H3K9me3 brain regions** (strengthens WP2) Data needed: Y-stratified GWAS results, Roadmap Epigenomics H3K9me3 annotations for brain tissues Analysis: Test whether haplogroup I-specific hits map to regions normally marked by H3K9me3 in brain. Why it matters: The sink model predicts that haplogroup I (more heterochromatin → more sequestration of HP1/SUV39H) leads to "leaky" heterochromatin. SNPs in normally silent H3K9me3 regions reaching significance only in haplogroup I background would be strong evidence. Effort: Moderate — Roadmap annotations are public, need to intersect with GWAS output.

### Tier 2 — High impact, moderate effort

**5. X–Y interaction in iPSYCH** Data needed: X chromosome genotypes + Y haplogroup assignments for iPSYCH males Analysis: Test whether effect sizes of X-linked ASD risk variants differ by Y haplogroup. Could use GEM or simple interaction model. Why it matters: Would be the first evidence that both sex chromosomes jointly modulate ASD risk. Even a suggestive signal would justify WP3.3 and make the "unified framework" argument concrete. Effort: Moderate-high — requires X chromosome GWAS to be run first (or use existing X-linked candidate SNPs).

**6. X chromosome PRS adds to autosomal PRS** Data needed: iPSYCH X chromosome genotypes, autosomal PRS already computed Analysis: Build X-linked PRS, test incremental R² beyond autosomal PRS. Why it matters: Directly quantifies what the field is missing by excluding X from GWAS. Even a small but significant ΔR² makes a powerful argument for WP1.1. Effort: Moderate — depends on how far Shannon's X chromosome GWAS has progressed.

**7. Female XCI-escape enrichment** Data needed: iPSYCH female cases/controls, XCI escape gene annotations (from Tukiainen et al. 2017 or similar) Analysis: In females, test whether ASD association is stronger among X-linked genes that escape XCI vs those that don't. Why it matters: Directly tests the dosage-conflict prediction from a different angle — if selfish genes escape both MSCI and XCI, females get excess dosage from escaping genes. Already partially supported by the MAGMA XCI-escape result (p=0.027) but a female-specific test would be a clean replication. Effort: Moderate — depends on female GWAS status.

**8. Temporal dynamics of selection** Data needed: Existing Relate genealogies from intern thesis Analysis: For the 9 ASD-associated positively selected genes, estimate timing of selection episodes. Do they cluster at the 45–55 kBP burst identified by Skov et al.? Why it matters: Would show that the same sweep episode that displaced Neanderthal admixture also drove ASD-relevant genes to high frequency — a dramatic connection between archaic admixture and modern disease risk. Effort: Moderate — Relate trees exist, need CLUES or similar for timing estimation.

### Tier 3 — Would be nice, harder before deadline

**9. Autosomal chromatin differences between X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa** Data needed: Hi-C or ATAC-seq from FACS-sorted X- vs Y-bearing sperm (may not exist) Analysis: Compare A/B compartment profiles on autosomes between the two cell types. Why it matters: Direct evidence that Y chromosome presence/absence alters autosomal chromatin state — the most direct test of the sink model in humans. Effort: High — depends on whether sorted sperm Hi-C data exists or can be generated.

**10. Population differences in X-linked ASD architecture** Data needed: Population-stratified GWAS or 1000 Genomes data Analysis: Test whether populations with different X chromosome selection histories have different X-linked ASD genetic architectures. Why it matters: Supports the evolutionary dynamics argument in WP3. Effort: High — requires multi-population analysis.

**11. Doublecortin family deep dive** Data needed: Selection signals (Relate), expression data (scRNA-seq), ASD association (SFARI/iPSYCH) for DCX, DCLK1, DCLK2, DCX2 Analysis: Show that the DCX family sits at the intersection of neuronal migration, sperm motility, recent selection, and ASD association. Why it matters: A compelling case study for the narrative and a potential figure panel. DCX regulates both microtubule dynamics in growing neurons and flagellar beating in sperm. Effort: Moderate — mostly synthesis of existing results across the gene family.
