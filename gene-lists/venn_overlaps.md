# Venn Diagram Gene Overlaps

Three-way Venn: SFARI ASD genes × Recent positive selection (Relate) × Differentially expressed in X/Y spermatids

## Triple overlap: SFARI ∩ Selection ∩ Diff. expr. (5 genes, ***)
CDKL5, CLCN4, HUWE1, IL1RAPL1, PTCHD1

## SFARI ∩ Selection only (5 genes, ***)
CASK, FRMPD4, PTCHD1-AS, DMD, TMLHE

## Selection ∩ Diff. expr. only (4 genes, **)
ENOX2, PAK3, PRKX, RTL4

## SFARI ∩ Diff. expr. only (22 genes, ***)
AFF2, ATRX, BRWD3, DDX3X, GABRA3, IQSEC2, KDM6A, LAS1L, MSL3, OCRL, OFD1, OPHN1, PCDH11X, PHF8, RLIM, SMC1A, SYP, TAF1, TSPAN7, UPF3B, USP9X, WNK3

## Counts (non-overlapping regions)
- SFARI only: 45
- Diff. expr. only: 82
- Selection only: 26
- SFARI ∩ Diff. expr.: 22 (***)
- SFARI ∩ Selection: 5 (***)
- Selection ∩ Diff. expr.: 4 (**)
- Triple overlap: 5 (***)
