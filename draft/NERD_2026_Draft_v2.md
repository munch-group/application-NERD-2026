## 2. BRIEF PROJECT DESCRIPTION (max 2,000 characters)

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects nearly 3% of children in Denmark and shows a striking 4:1 male-to-female ratio that remains unexplained. This project proposes that both sex chromosomes actively contribute to ASD risk through distinct evolutionary mechanisms — the X chromosome through meiotic drive and the Y chromosome through heterochromatin-mediated gene regulation — and that understanding these mechanisms will transform our knowledge of ASD's genetic architecture.

On the X chromosome, selfish gene variants escape meiotic sex chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis, gaining a transmission advantage even when the same variants are mildly deleterious for brain development. Because one in four neuron genes is also expressed in spermatids, this intragenomic conflict continuously pumps ASD-relevant variation into human populations. On the Y chromosome, haplogroups carrying different amounts of heterochromatin may differentially sequester chromatin-modifying proteins, creating haplogroup-dependent epistatic landscapes that modulate ASD penetrance.

The project will (1) develop population genomic methods to detect ongoing meiotic drive in humans, (2) perform the first systematic X chromosome association study of ASD using large clinical cohorts, (3) test whether Y chromosome haplogroups modulate autosomal and X-linked ASD risk, and (4) build evolutionary models integrating sex chromosome conflict with neurodevelopmental disease. The project combines methodology from evolutionary genomics with clinical cohort data, addressing questions that fall between traditional disciplines.

### Introduction: The Missing Sex Chromosomes in Autism Genetics

The 4:1 male excess in autism spectrum disorder is one of the most robust findings in psychiatric genetics, yet its explanation remains elusive. The X chromosome explains 20% of neuro-anatomical variation relevant to ASD while constituting only 5% of the genome [Mallard et al. 2021], and an estimated 80% of brain proteins are also found in the testis [Matos et al. 2021]. Despite this evidence for a privileged role of the sex chromosomes in neurodevelopment, most genome-wide association studies have excluded the X chromosome from analysis due to its complex inheritance pattern, and the Y chromosome has been ignored entirely. This project aims to fill this gap by investigating how evolutionary forces acting on both sex chromosomes shape the genetic architecture of ASD and its male bias.

The conceptual framework for this project is intragenomic conflict — the principle that gene variants can spread in a population by promoting their own transmission, even at a cost to the organism carrying them. Sex chromosomes are a unique arena for such conflicts because X and Y compete for transmission during spermatogenesis. An X-linked gene variant can promote its own transmission by escaping meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), a form of selfish behaviour known as meiotic drive. Such drive has been documented across vertebrates, insects, fungi, and plants [Zanders & Unckless 2019], and recent evidence demonstrates that the human X chromosome has experienced recurrent bursts of extraordinarily strong natural selection consistent with meiotic drive [Anonymised Reference 1]. The core proposal of this project is that intragenomic conflict on the sex chromosomes — meiotic drive on the X and heterochromatin-mediated regulation by the Y — is a major unrecognised contributor to the genetic architecture of ASD and its pronounced male bias.

### The X Chromosome: Meiotic Drive and Its Consequences for the Brain

The human X chromosome shows a unique pattern of recurrent strong natural selection. The most recent episode, occurring 45,000–55,000 years ago, involved strong selection at fourteen loci that dramatically affected allele frequencies across 10% of the chromosome [Anonymised Reference 1]. The scale and recurrence of this phenomenon is exclusive to the X chromosome and strongly suggests selection on gene function in male spermatogenesis — precisely the condition required for meiotic drive.

This matters for neurodevelopment because of a remarkable overlap between the transcriptomes of brain and testis. A proteomic comparison reveals that 80% of brain proteins are also found in testis [Matos et al. 2021], and more specifically, 24–25% of neuron genes are also expressed in male spermatids. This overlap creates the conditions for an evolutionary conflict: variants selected for their role in spermatogenesis may have collateral effects on brain development. If the selective advantage gained through meiotic drive exceeds the fitness cost of impaired brain function — as it readily can, since drive confers a large transmission advantage — then natural selection will continuously pump ASD-relevant variation into human populations.

This conflict can operate through at least three mechanisms. First, the dosage-conflict hypothesis: MSCI in males and somatic X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females likely evolved from the same highly conserved mechanism of un-synapsed chromatin silencing [Hornecker et al. 2007]. Supporting this shared mechanism, super-loops established by CTCF binding at the XIST, FIRRE, and DXZ4 loci are crucial to proper X inactivation, and DXZ4 has been shown to function as a speciation gene in cats through its effect on MSCI — demonstrating that the same loci control both silencing mechanisms. If selfish genes escape MSCI in males, they are likely to also escape XCI in females. Because the X spends two-thirds of its evolutionary time in females and one-third in males, selection will favour resolution of the resulting female excess dosage through reduced expression from both X chromosomes. This leads to dosage deficiency in males, who carry only a single X — a direct path to male-specific neurodevelopmental risk.

Second, the hitchhiking hypothesis predicts that ASD risk variants located near genes under strong meiotic drive will "hitchhike" to higher population frequencies than equivalent variants on autosomes. On a non-recombining chromosome, an allele linked to a driver will increase in frequency even if it is mildly deleterious. Because recombination on the X chromosome is restricted to females (the X does not recombine in males), linked selection is particularly effective — and this is compounded by the X chromosome's smaller effective population size (three-quarters of autosomes). The hitchhiking model predicts a positive correlation between the strength of local selection and the population frequency of ASD risk alleles, a prediction directly testable in clinical cohort data.

Third, a compartment border escape mechanism may explain how selfish genes evade silencing at the molecular level. Analysis of 3D chromatin architecture through spermatogenesis reveals that selective sweep regions on the X chromosome significantly overlap the boundaries between active and inactive chromatin domains (A/B compartment borders), specifically in spermatogonia (p = 0.017), pachytene spermatocytes (p = 0.006), round spermatids (p = 0.005), and in human spermatozoa (p = 0.028) [Anonymised Reference 5]. This overlap suggests that selfish X-linked genes exploit the chromatin reorganisation occurring at compartment boundaries during spermatogenesis to escape meiotic silencing. A Bayesian method has been developed to precisely locate A/B compartment borders, enabling fine-scale mapping of the relationship between selection and chromatin architecture [Anonymised Reference 5].

Comparative genomics provides independent support for the meiotic drive framework. The tubulin-modifying enzyme TTLL11 has been independently inactivated in both humans and gorillas but remains functional in chimpanzees. TTLL11 polyglutamylates tubulin and is required for directional sperm motility; knockout mice produce sperm that swim in circles. One hypothesis is that TTLL11 inactivation evolved as a defence against an X-linked meiotic driver that co-opted TTLL11-dependent microtubule transport across spermatid bridges to create segregation distortion. This convergent inactivation in two great ape lineages — both with low sperm competition — illustrates how meiotic drive can leave deep evolutionary signatures in the genome.

### Converging Preliminary Evidence for the X Chromosome Hypothesis

Five independent lines of preliminary evidence converge on the meiotic drive hypothesis. First, pilot analyses using MAGMA on a large clinical cohort yield results consistent with each prediction of the dosage-conflict hypothesis [Anonymised Reference 2]. In males, neuron genes co-expressed in spermatids are significantly enriched for ASD association (p = 0.030, β = 0.14), whereas neuron genes without spermatid expression show no enrichment — confirming that it is specifically the dual-expressed genes that carry risk. ASD association in males is also elevated among genes escaping female XCI (p = 0.027, β = 0.03), consistent with MSCI-escape genes also escaping XCI. In females, ASD association is concentrated among gametologs — candidate meiotic driver genes with a Y chromosome homolog (p = 0.026, β = 0.45) [Anonymised Reference 2]. Gene Ontology analysis reveals that the neuron-spermatid overlap genes are enriched for cytosol genes (44% enrichment) and extracellular exosome genes (two-fold enrichment), while chromatin regulators are conspicuously absent — suggesting the conflict acts primarily through cytoplasmic transport and signalling rather than transcriptional regulation. Among the key dual-expressed genes, several are both XCI-escapers and differentially expressed between spermatogenesis stages: DDX3X, HUWE1, UBA1, SYAP1, and FMR1 — each with well-established roles in neurodevelopment [Anonymised Reference 2].

Second, an independent analysis using the Relate genealogy method on 1000 Genomes data identified 35 positively selected genes on the X chromosome, of which 9 are ASD-associated (Fisher's exact test, p = 5.95 × 10⁻⁵). Positive selection was significantly more common in genes active in both spermatids and brain compared to brain-only genes (p = 0.002) [Anonymised Reference 3], directly linking the evolutionary signal to the neuron-spermatid conflict.

Third, single-cell RNA expression data through spermatogenesis allows identification of X-linked genes expressed post-meiotically — genes that must have escaped or reactivated after MSCI and are therefore direct candidates for meiotic drive. Critically, this provides a far more precise test of the meiotic drive hypothesis than bulk tissue annotations: rather than asking whether a gene is expressed "in testis," one can ask whether it is expressed specifically in round spermatids or spermatozoa — the cell types where drive operates. Analysis of these data reveals that known ASD genes from the SFARI database are significantly enriched among genes differentially expressed between X-carrying and Y-carrying spermatids (p = 0.004) [Anonymised Reference 6]. This is a particularly compelling result because post-meiotic spermatids share cytoplasm through intercellular bridges, meaning most transcripts are distributed equally between cell types. Genes that nonetheless show differential expression must act cell-autonomously or be regulated by the sex chromosome complement itself. The enrichment of ASD genes among these differentially expressed genes provides direct evidence that the molecular distinction between X- and Y-bearing spermatids — the very distinction on which meiotic drive operates — disproportionately involves genes relevant to neurodevelopment. Furthermore, these differentially expressed X chromosome genes are significantly enriched at A/B compartment borders (p = 0.003) [Anonymised References 5, 6], connecting the expression-level evidence directly to the 3D chromatin architecture.

Fourth, these three independent gene sets — SFARI ASD genes, genes under recent positive selection, and genes differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing spermatids — can be intersected to identify the strongest meiotic driver candidates. This triple intersection identifies five genes present in all three sets: CDKL5, CLCN4, HUWE1, IL1RAPL1, and PTCHD1 [Anonymised References 3, 6]. Each is a well-established X-linked ASD gene. CDKL5 encodes a kinase essential for neuronal synapse formation whose mutations cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. HUWE1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase critical for brain development. IL1RAPL1 regulates synapse formation and is one of the most frequently disrupted genes in ASD. PTCHD1 is involved in Hedgehog signalling and is among the best-replicated X-linked ASD risk genes. CLCN4 encodes a chloride channel implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. That these five genes are simultaneously under positive selection, differentially expressed between X- and Y-bearing spermatids, and associated with ASD is precisely what the meiotic drive hypothesis predicts: they are candidate selfish genes whose transmission advantage in spermatogenesis comes at a cost to neurodevelopment. All pairwise overlaps between the three sets are also statistically significant, confirming the convergence is not driven by any single comparison.

Fifth, the Hi-C analysis of compartment borders described above provides a mechanistic link between selection and spermatogenesis-specific chromatin architecture, grounding the convergent genetic evidence in a plausible molecular mechanism for MSCI escape.

### The Y Chromosome: Heterochromatin as a Sink for Chromatin Regulators

While the X chromosome hypothesis rests on meiotic drive, the Y chromosome may contribute to ASD risk through an entirely different mechanism: the heterochromatin sink. The Y chromosome is the most intensively studied heterochromatin sink in genetics. In Drosophila, adding or removing Y chromosomes causes measurable genome-wide redistribution of H3K9me2/3 at pericentromeric regions [Brown et al. 2020]. The mechanism involves mass-action competition: key chromatin proteins — HP1, SUV39H, and H3K9 methyltransferases — exist in limiting quantities and are titrated by heterochromatic DNA. Increasing the amount of heterochromatin sequesters more of these factors, reducing their availability for silencing elsewhere in the genome. In Drosophila, XYY males and XXY females show dramatic reduction of H3K9me2/3 enrichment at repeat-rich regions, and boundaries between heterochromatic pericentromere and euchromatic chromosome arms become blurred with additional Y chromosome material [Brown et al. 2020].

Recent assembly of 43 human Y chromosomes reveals that this variation also exists in humans [Rhie et al. 2023]. The centromeric α-satellite arrays show greater than two-fold size differences between haplogroups (haplogroup R1b: mean 341 kbp; haplogroup I: mean 787 kbp), and the DYZ1 satellite repeat varies over an order of magnitude (7–98 Mbp), correlating with haplogroup membership. This variation in heterochromatin content could produce haplogroup-dependent titration of chromatin-modifying proteins.

The connection to ASD is direct: chromatin remodelling has emerged as a central pathway in ASD genetics. Genome-wide analyses have identified numerous ASD candidate genes encoding nuclear factors implicated in chromatin remodelling, histone demethylation, histone variants, and DNA methylation recognition. High-confidence ASD risk genes include CHD8 (an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that binds H3K4me3 and regulates other ASD risk genes), KDM5C (a histone demethylase), SETD5 (a histone methyltransferase), and ADNP, CHD2, POGZ, and KMT5B [De Rubeis et al. 2014]. Disruption of the H3K4me3 landscape has been directly observed in autism frontal cortex samples. If Y haplogroup heterochromatin content modulates the nuclear availability of these chromatin-modifying proteins, it would create haplogroup-dependent epistatic landscapes for ASD risk.

The predictions are specific and testable. Haplogroup I, with its higher heterochromatin content, is predicted to cause greater sequestration of HP1, SUV39H, and H3K9 methyltransferases, leading to reduced autosomal heterochromatin formation at pericentromeric regions and increased chromatin accessibility at normally silenced regions. Haplogroup R, with lower heterochromatin, should maintain stronger autosomal heterochromatin and more defined euchromatin–heterochromatin boundaries. Most Danish men carry a Y chromosome from either the I or the R haplogroup, making a Danish clinical cohort an ideal testing ground.

Preliminary evidence supports these predictions. Stratifying males in a large clinical ASD cohort by their Y chromosome haplogroup (I vs R) reveals that different autosomal SNPs reach significance depending on haplogroup background [Anonymised Reference 4]. This suggests context-dependent epistasis mediated by Y chromosome chromatin state — precisely what the sink model predicts.

An important caveat must be acknowledged: while the heterochromatin sink is well-established in Drosophila, its relevance in mammals is debated. Whether the same mechanism operates in humans, or whether mammalian Y chromosomes modulate autosomal expression through different pathways (e.g. ZFX/ZFY transcription factors), remains an open question. Testing this directly in human ASD cohorts represents a high-risk, high-reward component of the project — exactly the kind of exploratory science the NERD programme is designed to support. If the Y chromosome turns out not to function as a heterochromatin sink in humans, the haplogroup-stratified GWAS will still reveal any form of Y-dependent epistasis, which would itself be a novel finding.

### Research Plan

The project is organised into three work packages that progress from the best-supported hypothesis (X chromosome meiotic drive) through the higher-risk Y chromosome work to the integrative evolutionary modelling that ties the two together.

**Work Package 1: The X Chromosome — Detecting Meiotic Drive and Its Consequences (Years 1–4)**

The first and most extensive work package will establish the relationship between meiotic drive and ASD on the X chromosome through four interconnected sub-projects.

The centrepiece is a systematic X chromosome GWAS of ASD in a large clinical cohort comprising more than 17,000 male cases and 5,500 female cases. New population genomic methods will be developed that are sensitive to rare X-linked variants by embedding standard linear mixed models for GWAS in population genomic models of cohort ancestry [Zhang et al. 2023], directly modelling ancestry along the X chromosome to increase power over standard imputation. Both dosage-based and hard-call genotypes will be evaluated to assess the impact of dosage compensation modelling. ASD heritability on the X chromosome will be estimated using stratified LD score regression and partitioned across nested gene sets: spermatid-neuron overlap genes, XCI escapees, gametologs, and genes in selective sweep regions. X-linked polygenic risk scores will be built and tested for incremental predictive power beyond autosomal PRS — quantifying what the field misses by excluding the X chromosome. To test the hitchhiking prediction, the likelihood ratio of positive selection at each X-linked SNP will be computed using genealogy-based methods, and the expected positive correlation between selection strength and risk-allele frequency will be evaluated. Data from unexploited X chromosome data in PGC and SPARK cohorts will be pooled to increase sample size and population diversity.

A second sub-project will identify genes that escape MSCI and test whether they are meiotic drivers. Single-cell RNA expression data across spermatogenesis will be used to identify X-linked genes with post-meiotic expression — genes that must have escaped or reactivated after MSCI. These MSCI escapees will be tested for enrichment among ASD-associated genes from SFARI and from a large clinical cohort GWAS. Cross-referencing with the Relate selection analysis and SFARI gene lists has already identified five genes in the triple overlap — CDKL5, CLCN4, HUWE1, IL1RAPL1, and PTCHD1 — each a well-established X-linked ASD gene [Anonymised Reference 6]. These are the strongest meiotic driver candidates and will receive focused attention. Expression trajectories of candidate genes through spermatogenesis stages will be characterised: genes showing silencing during pachytene followed by reactivation in spermatids provide direct evidence of MSCI escape.

A third sub-project will investigate the 3D chromatin architecture underlying meiotic drive. Hi-C data across spermatogenesis stages will be analysed to determine how A/B compartment borders relate to selfish gene regions. The Bayesian compartment border detection method already developed [Anonymised Reference 5] will be applied to precisely map boundaries in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa, testing whether genes escaping MSCI cluster at compartment boundaries — providing a mechanistic link between chromatin reorganisation and meiotic drive. As human spermatogenesis Hi-C datasets become available, the analysis will be extended from the current macaque data to human.

A fourth sub-project will characterise the gene functions and pathways shared between spermatids and neurons that are under selection. Preliminary GO analysis shows enrichment for cytosol and extracellular exosome genes, suggesting the conflict operates through cytoplasmic transport and signalling pathways. Particular attention will be given to the Doublecortin (DCX) family: DCX is the master X-linked regulator of neuronal migration (through microtubule stabilisation) and is also required for sperm motility. It shows strong recent selection and is associated with ASD, making it a prime case study for the conflict hypothesis. The TTLL11 inactivation will be investigated as a model for how organisms defend against meiotic drive, and the X-linked intercellular bridge transport genes — including those in the tubulin code — will be examined as potential driver or driver-interacting candidates. Multivariate PGS regression will be used to test for differential genetic load across ASD subtypes, evaluating whether the meiotic drive gene set explains phenotypic variation within the autism spectrum.

**Work Package 2: The Y Chromosome — Haplogroup-Dependent Epistasis (Years 2–5)**

The second work package tests the heterochromatin sink hypothesis by examining whether Y chromosome haplogroups modulate ASD risk through epistatic interactions.

Y haplogroups will be assigned to each male in the clinical cohort using Y-chromosomal SNPs and validated against the T2T-CHM13 Y chromosome assemblies. The cohort will then be partitioned by haplogroup (I vs R and subgroups) for independent autosomal association tests. SNP-by-haplogroup interaction terms will be formally tested genome-wide using GEM (Gene-Environment interaction in Millions), treating haplogroup as the "environment." Effect size heterogeneity between haplogroups will be calculated, and SNPs with significant differential effects will be identified. The analysis will be extended to African American cohorts, where deeply diverged Y haplogroups provide a more extreme test of the sink hypothesis.

The chromatin landscape analysis will map haplogroup-specific significant SNPs to Roadmap Epigenomics chromatin states for brain tissues — prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Enrichment in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin, H3K4me3-marked promoters, and enhancers will be tested using LDSC-SEG and GoShifter. The key prediction will be tested directly: SNPs near euchromatin–heterochromatin boundaries should show stronger haplogroup I effects, using the T2T-CHM13 assembly with its complete pericentromeric annotations. If methylation data with Y haplogroup information becomes available, haplogroup-associated differentially methylated regions at pericentromeric boundaries and ASD gene promoters will be tested.

Haplogroup-specific gene lists will be mapped to GO terms, KEGG pathways, and Reactome, focusing on chromatin modification, synaptic function, and neurodevelopmental pathways. A critical test is whether genes significant in different haplogroup backgrounds converge on the same pathways despite being different genes — evidence for the same biology being affected through different chromatin routes. Haplogroup-specific PRS will be built and tested for improved ASD risk prediction compared to unstratified models, and the implications for missing heritability will be assessed: what fraction of heritability that appears missing in a combined analysis is recovered when stratifying by Y haplogroup?

**Work Package 3: Evolutionary Modelling (Years 3–6)**

The third work package develops formal theoretical models that integrate the empirical findings from work packages 1 and 2 into a unified evolutionary framework.

Population genetic models of X-linked meiotic drive with pleiotropic effects on neurodevelopment will be developed, parameterising the transmission ratio distortion, the fitness cost in brain function, and the frequency-dependent dynamics. These models will predict the steady-state ASD risk generated by the evolutionary pump: given realistic parameters for drive strength and fitness costs, what equilibrium frequency of ASD-relevant variation does the conflict maintain? The models will predict the expected polygenic architecture under the conflict model versus neutral expectations — specifically, excess common variation at dual-expressed genes, higher risk-allele frequencies near selected loci, and enrichment of ASD association on the X chromosome — all testable predictions. As a concrete application, the expected increase in population-averaged polygenic risk for ASD will be computed for the period when selective sweep regions rose to high frequency during the 45–55 kBP sweep episode.

Stochastic simulations of chromatin factor distribution across nuclear compartments will be built, varying the heterochromatin load to match haplogroup I versus R. These simulations will predict which genomic regions are most affected by factor depletion and whether the predictions match the empirically observed haplogroup-specific association signals from work package 2. Boundary effects will be modelled: how sharp are the predicted euchromatin–heterochromatin transitions under different factor concentrations, and do the empirical T2T annotations match?

Finally, the project will test for X–Y interaction effects in the clinical data: does the effect of X-linked risk variants depend on Y haplogroup? This would be the first evidence that both sex chromosomes jointly modulate ASD risk. The combined contribution of X meiotic drive and Y chromatin regulation to ASD's male bias will be modelled — can this evolutionary framework quantitatively explain the 4:1 sex ratio? A unified evolutionary framework for sex chromosome contributions to complex disease will be developed, applicable to other sex-biased disorders including ADHD, schizophrenia, and autoimmune conditions. All models, simulations, and analytical tools will be made available as open-source software.

### Creativity, Ambition, and Originality

This project is original in three ways. First, it proposes that intragenomic conflict — a fundamental evolutionary force — has direct consequences for human disease. While meiotic drive has been studied extensively in model organisms, no one has connected it to a specific human disorder. The idea that selfish X-linked genes continuously pump ASD-relevant variation into human populations represents a paradigm shift in understanding the genetic architecture of neurodevelopmental disorders. The five converging lines of preliminary evidence — MAGMA enrichments, Relate selection scans, single-cell spermatid expression data, Hi-C compartment border analysis, and the triple-overlap of five known ASD genes — provide unusually strong support for what is fundamentally a new hypothesis.

Second, it introduces the Y chromosome as an active modulator of ASD risk through chromatin regulation. The Y has been entirely ignored in ASD genetics. If haplogroup-dependent epistasis proves real, it would explain a substantial portion of ASD's "missing heritability" and provide a mechanistic basis for its male bias beyond simple X-linkage. The risk profile of this component — well-established in Drosophila but debated in mammals — is appropriate for the exploratory spirit of this programme.

Third, it bridges evolutionary genomics and psychiatric genetics — two fields that rarely interact. The methods and conceptual framework developed here will be applicable to any complex trait with sex bias, including ADHD, schizophrenia, anorexia, and depression. The project establishes a new paradigm: that the evolutionary dynamics of sex chromosomes are not merely a curiosity of genome biology but a force that actively shapes the landscape of human disease.

### Future Applications in Life Sciences and Health Sciences

The proposed research has potential future applications across several domains. By revealing how evolutionary forces on sex chromosomes shape ASD risk, the project could identify new classes of risk genes and pathways that current approaches miss entirely. The enrichment of ASD genes among MSCI escapees and among genes at A/B compartment borders points toward specific molecular mechanisms — cytoplasmic transport, ubiquitin signalling, and chromatin boundary regulation — that may prove relevant for therapeutic development.

Haplogroup-stratified polygenic risk scores may substantially improve ASD risk prediction in males. If validated, this would represent one of the first examples of incorporating sex chromosome variation into clinical genomics. The X chromosome association methods developed here will be broadly useful, enabling systematic inclusion of X-linked markers in GWAS of any trait — addressing a major gap in a field that routinely excludes 5% of the genome from studies that claim to be "genome-wide."

More broadly, the project establishes a new framework for understanding how intragenomic conflict contributes to human disease, applicable to other sex-biased disorders. Understanding the X chromosome's disproportionate contribution to ASD is crucial for improved diagnosis and support of neuro-divergent individuals, particularly as the proportion diagnosed in Denmark approaches 3%.

## 4. LAY PROJECT DESCRIPTION (max 1,000 characters)

Autism is increasingly common, affecting nearly 3% of Danish children, and is four times more prevalent in boys than girls. This sex difference remains unexplained. This project investigates whether "selfish" genes on the sex chromosomes contribute to autism risk. On the X chromosome, gene variants that enhance sperm production spread through populations even when they mildly impair brain development. On the Y chromosome, structural differences between lineages may alter which autism risk genes become active. By combining evolutionary genetics with analysis of large clinical datasets, this project aims to uncover new genetic mechanisms underlying autism and its male bias.
